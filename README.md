# 🔋 EV Charging Behavior Prediction Dashboard

This Streamlit-based dashboard allows users to analyze electric vehicle (EV) charging behavior and predict the energy delivered during charging sessions using a Gradient Boosting Regressor. It integrates interactive EDA, visualizations, and a machine learning model trained on a global EV charging dataset.
